# Character Movement System

This repo contains my (currently unfinished) character movement system for GameMaker Studio 2. It is meant to encapsulate some common functionality for managing sprites, character movement state, player input handling both for grid-based movement and free movement, and any other aspects that come to mind during developing of this system.

# Goal

I would like to create something that can be plugged into a game and leveraged to cut down on scripting for things like
- Cutscene scripting
- NPC AI
- Player Character sprite management when moving
- ...

Having used RPG Maker as a kid, I became pretty spoiled with the eventing and sprite system of the various RM engines. In GMS2, making my own eventing system inspired by RM engines will provide some much-needed structure that'll cut down on imperative code and open up opportunities for greater levels of abstraction of common coding tasks.
