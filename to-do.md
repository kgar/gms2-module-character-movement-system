# To Do
- Create a few NPCs and enforce collision detection
- Create some lightweight scripts for NPC random movement that leverages the movement driver to set NPC state and move them around
- Make sure NPCs and PC don't overstep when walking toward one another
- ...

# Refactor
- Is there a more elegant way to handle the movement code?

# Stretch
- Support player character running.
  - You can swap out the RPG Maker sprite with an existing sprite that has a run animation, if you are feeling adventurous.
  - Sprite Resource has some Suikoden sprites ðŸ˜²
